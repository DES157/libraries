# Task Runners

Some say that Grunt and Require.js are being taken over by Gulp and Browerify.

Grunt and Gulp are Node based, not sure of others...

* [Grunt](grunt) - configuration-based
* Gulp - stream-based
* Cake - for simple tasks, uses CoffeeScript
* Broccoli - like Gulp with tasks based on code logic and a plugin system
