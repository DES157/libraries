## D3 Versions

Version 4 brings many changes!

* [D3 4.0 API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)

* [D3 3.x API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/API-Reference.md)

namespace flattening?

Note that v4 of D3.js brought significant changes over v3.

In [What Makes Software Good?](https://medium.com/@mbostock/what-makes-software-good-943557f8a488) Mike Bostock covers the design principles behind D3 and some of the details behind what's changed.


## D3 Basics



## D3 Concepts

D3 operates on arbitrary sets of nodes called *selections*.

`.selectAll`

`.data()`

> Once the data has been bound to the document, you can omit the data operator; D3 will retrieve the previously-bound data. This allows you to recompute properties without rebinding.

Is data bound to selection or to the node itself?

enter()
when there are fewer nodes than data

check but it seems that .enter() does not use previously bound data? i.e. can't just reuse selection, need to specify data at that time?


#### Selection


The *enter selection*

append()

The *exit selection*
`exit()`

join()


The D3 *general update pattern* involves a *data join* followed by operations on the resulting *enter*, *update*, and *exit* selections. A data-join joins a data array with selected elements (`selection.data(data)`). 

See [bl.ock/3808218](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218 "General Update Pattern, I") (but may from version 3).

See [Joining Date](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#joining-data) for the v4 general update pattern...

    var circle = svg.selectAll("circle").data(data)
        .style(...);
        
    circle.exit().remove();
    
    circle = circle.enter().append("circle")
        .style(...)
      .merge(circle)
        .style(...);

(Review a select, data, enter, append pattern?)

## D3 Components

### d3-selection

Selection are a core concept in d3. The [d3-selection README](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md) is great documentation, and the [Selections](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#selections-d3-selection) part of the API Reference is concise index into it.

Selection methods are often chained since they typically return the current selection or a new selection.

The [Selections](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Selections) page on the Wiki covers changes from version 3 to 4. Notable changes include that in version 4 

* selections (their elements and parents) are now immutable. Consequently the `sort()` and `data()` methods now return new selections whereas they used to modify in place
* `append()` no longer merges entering nodes into update selection (same with insert?), so a new method `merge()` was added to do that
* previously you needed to call `data()` before `enter()` or `exit()` (or else they were undefined), but now they simply return the empty selection if called before joining selection to data
* TODO review the part about append behavior with entering nodes and insert hack previosly needed to preserve order
* there is now only one class of selection, while in v3 enter selections were a special class with different append and select behaviour





s3.selectAll()

selection.select() review inheritance




selection.update()







selection.filter()

selection.merge() - new in v4, esp used to merge enter and update selections after a data-join since 

selection.datum()

selection.classed()
selection.text()
selection.attr()
selection.style()
selection.property()
selection.html()

#### selection methods

grouping!? and nested selections?


#### enter or update related methods

selection.enter()

  selection.append() - note change in behavior with v4 which makes insert hack on entering nodes unnecessary
  
  selection.insert()

#### exit related methods

selection.exit()

  selection.remove()
